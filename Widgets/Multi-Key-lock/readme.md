## About the widget

Anyone with a nut head can understand what this widget is for. If not, this is the basic version of multi password lock protection. Meaning, you can lock a page with multiple password to unlock it. (cool aaai)

Reason to create this:
* I don't like complex protection methods.
* I don't know how to create complexe protection method with php and server side.
* I don't have anything to protect that hard.
* I like to stay on frontend developing.

So that's why I created the `Multi-Key-Lock` widget in the first place.

### Built With

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JS

### Installation

1. First add or link the `Style.css` into your website head. (`<head></head>`)
2. Next add the error message in `Protected.html` at the top of the page.
3. Then add the authentication portal in `Authentication.html`
4. After that you can add the content you want to lock. Template with id is in the `Protected.html`.
5. Finally add the `Passlock.js` to the website or webpage, where you can easily access it or change it. (I prefer not to change `Master-Key`, and don't publish it.)
