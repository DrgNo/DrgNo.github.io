      <p>It's a great start for my blog. You know why. because now I have a whole fucking website for that.
<br><br>
So here is a brief lookup about the situation. I created my own website with my own coding and with my own github page. So the website is completely maintained by me. No third-party platforms like Blogger or WordPress are involved. Just straight up my own domain.
<br><br>
Also, I have added a bypass method in Oder to make instant views of blog posts. Now I don't have to drop a fucking shitlong of link bombs to generate an instant view. Now it's as simple as sharing a link.
<br><br>
Design is very human. And plain. no high-quality JS codes to smooth it. cause I don't have fucking time to do it. And I like this simplicity.
<br><br>
And that is all I have to say. This is the start of my blog. I'm very happy with it.</p>
